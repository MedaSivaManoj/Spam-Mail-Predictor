# Spam-Mail-Predictor
This project implements a Logistic Regression model to classify emails as spam or ham (not spam). Since the problem involves binary classification, Logistic Regression is an appropriate choice.

The textual data is processed and analyzed before being fed into the model for training.

The dataset used for this project was obtained from the Kaggle API:
